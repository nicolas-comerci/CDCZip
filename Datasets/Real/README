*** GENERAL INFORMATION ***

The Fslhomes dataset contains snapshots of students' home directories from a
shared network file system.  The snapshots were collected in the File system
and Storage Lab (FSL) at Stony Brook University.  A typical activity in the
lab involves code development and debugging, paper writing, and other office
activities.  The files consist of source code, binaries, office documents,
virtual machine images, and other miscellaneous files.

The snapshots were collected between the end of year 2011 and the beginning
of year 2015.  Upon joining the lab the students were added to the list of
active users and the snapshots of their home directories were preserved
daily.  After graduating, the students were removed from the active users
list.  If a student was out of the lab for a summer internship, we removed
him or her from the active users list for the duration of their internship.
In total, over the course of four years, 39 users were active during some
time period.  At any given time, anywhere from half a dozen to a dozen users
were active.

We tried to collect the snapshots daily but it was not always possible.  If
a snapshot for some date is missing, it means that for technical reasons the
file system was not scanned on that day.

Until Jan 25, 2012, the snapshots were collected with an average chunk size
of 8KiB.  Afterwards, the snapshots were collected with multiple average
chunk sizes of 2KiB, 4KiB, 8KiB, 16KiB, 32KiB, 64KiB, and 128KiB.  To make
it clearer to figure this, we separated the snapshots that we distribute
online, such that those that include only an 8kb chunking sizes are in a
folder named YYYY-8kb-only.

The date in the file's name corresponds to the date when the snapshot was
taken.  In addition, each hash file internally stores the anonymization
start and end dates.  The anonymization dates can be different from the
snapshot date because snapshots were anonymized later on.

For privacy reasons, file paths and chunk hashes were anonymized.  The
anonymization process ensured the preservation of parent-child relationship
between files and directories.  The process also guaranteed that the files
that had the same names in the original snapshots have the same anonymized
names.  To preserve valuable information about file types we did not
anonymize file extensions.

The fs-hasher package was used to collect the snapshots.  The package
contains both a tool to read the snapshots (hf-stat), as well as a tool to
collect the snapshots (fs-hasher).  The fs-hasher package is available for
download from both the FSL-hosted Web-site and the SNIA IOTTA repository:

	1) http://tracer.filesystems.org

	2) http://iotta.snia.org/tools

The server tracer.filesystems.org also hosts other traces and snapshots
collected by the File system and Storage Lab (FSL).  Any questions regarding
the snapshots and corresponding software should be sent to the following
mailing list:
